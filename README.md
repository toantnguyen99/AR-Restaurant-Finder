# AR-Restaurant-Finder
A hackathon group project to create an AR program using Dart and Flutter UI development kit to find local restaurants information and display them in real-time as Augmented Reality objects. Some of the main tools we used are Google API and iOS ARKit plugins. We built it with Node.js backend and Flutter frontend and used git for version control.
